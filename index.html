            <!--Using P tags for paragraphs of information-->
            The community that surrounds EDM music festivals is amazing. One of
            the most incredible aspects of these festivals is the sense of
            inclusivity and acceptance that fills the air. When you arrive
            everyone could be a stranger, soon to be a friend. Everyone is there
            for the same reason, for the love of music and to have an amazing
            experience, where they can be accepted for who they are and not feel
            judged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Camping at these festivals adds so much more to a music festival. The
            camps become hangouts where strangers become friends and share
            stories, food, or even talents. I have met so many amazing people that
            were just right beside my camp. They are now lifelong friends that i
            will cherish forever. The sense of community that you get when you are
            in the campground is nothing like i've experienced in my everday life.
