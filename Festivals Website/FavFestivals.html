            Electric Forest is a Music Festival in Rothbury Michigan. It is a 4
            day camping music festival in June starting on a thursday and ending
            on sunday. This is my number one favorite music festival because of
            the whole vibe. Everyone around you is so kind, caring, and
            respectful. This festival doesnt usually have a super crazy lineup so
            you have time to relax instead of constantly going to make it to see
            someone. A big part of this festival is inside of a forest, where
            there is art setup everywhere and hammocks everywhere to relax in.
            They even have a scavenger hunt that you can do and if you finish you
            get access to a secret area or to see a secret artist. This festival
            has alot of walking, i would walk over 10 miles each day. Electric
            Forest has around 8-10 stages throughout the entire festival, but they
            are very spread out.

            Okeechobee is held in Okeechobee Florida. This is another camping
            festival with a similar vibe to Electric Forest. It starts on a
            thursday and ends on a sunday. There is a bid lake that you have
            access to and they added sand so you can swim if you want to cool down
            on a hot day. This Festival is usually held toward the beginning of
            march so the weather gets warm, but not too hot. Okeechobee is a
            pretty big festival, but i wouldnt say its as much walking as Electric
            Forest. Okeechobee has 5-6 stages total throughout the festival.

            EDC Las Vegas is a 3 day music festival that is usually in may and
            held in the Las Vegas Motor Speedway which is about 45 minutes from
            the strip. The festival starts on Friday at 3pm and goes until sunrise
            each day so by the time you get back to your hotel it will be around
            8am the next day. This festival is massive and the stages are huge,
            but this festival is not for the weak. There is alot of walking and if
            you stay the entire time everyday, dont expect to get much sleep. EDC
            has around 10 stages throughout the entire venue.
